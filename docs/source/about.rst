=============

This wiki will hopefully contain everything you need to know to get setup and running with the bot.

the bot is windows and debian-based linux only right now because i'm actively devving with these enviornments, which are Win10 and Ubuntu Bionic Beaver, so i ask anyone with Mac experience to get in touch so i can get mac instructions written up for Mac users!
