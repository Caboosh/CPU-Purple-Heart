About my bot.
=============

This wiki will hopefully contain everything you need to know to get setup and running with the bot.

So far, its windows only because i'm actively devving on my home PC which is running Win10, but i will add instructions for Debian based Distros some time down the line as that's what i'm most familiar with.

Nep will hopefully end up being a full featured bot that can either be selfhosted or invited, depending on what you want to do with her, if you want to get involved with helping me with the bot, mention me on discord, my thing is @. Cabooshy#6969
