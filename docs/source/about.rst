About my bot.
=============

This wiki will hopefully contain everything you need to know to get setup and running with the bot.

the bot is Windows and Debian-based linux only right now because i'm actively devving with these environments, Specifically Win10 1803 and Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver, so i ask anyone with Mac experience to get in touch so i can get mac instructions written up for Mac users!

Nep will hopefully end up being a full featured bot that can either be selfhosted or invited, depending on what you want to do with her, if you want to get involved with helping me with the bot, mention me on discord, my thing is @. Cabooshy#6969


Commands:
=========

So far, the bot has:

+ The ability to do some basic things, like echo commands, show profiles, and set its playing status and avy.
+ The ability to load cogs, so she can be extended however you need to.
+ The ability (with some tinkering) to push and pull to a specified repo (usually good to set it up to a fork if you have forked her)
+ The ability to Ban, Massban, Softban (no kicking yet, need to write the commands) as basic guild moderation
+ More to come obviously!
