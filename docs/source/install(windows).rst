Installing the bot on Windows
=============================

Installing Nep on Windows is rather easy, and this page will help walk you through the steps of doing so.

Lets start off with getting python installed, download the `latest version <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ of python, with a minimum version of 3.5 (3.6.5 will do just fine, a minimum of 3.5 because of aiohttp, and it doesn't support 3.4)
