Installing the bot on Windows
=============================

Installing Nep on Windows is rather easy, and this page will help walk you through the steps of doing so.

Lets start off with getting python installed, download the `latest version <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ of python, with a minimum version of 3.5 (3.6.5 will do just fine, a minimum of 3.5 because of aiohttp, and it doesn't support 3.4)
if you want to try Python 3.7, then go ahead, and if there are any problems, open an issue and i will update my venv so i can test these

Go through the install process, making sure to add Python to your PATH. this is usually a checkbox on the lower of the install window.

Now, we need to download nep, so to do that, `head here <https://github.com/Caboosh/CPU-Purple-Heart/releases>`_ and download the latest version available.
