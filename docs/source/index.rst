Our Lovable CPU of Planeptune, Neptune, has somehow smashed the 4th wall hard enough to make it onto discord, don't ask me how, she just did, alrite?
Nep can do pretty much what other bots can do, and more!

**Bot Features:**

- Admin Commands for easy administering of servers
- Mod Commands to help with peacekeeping
- Economy features, with a slot machine and bank system
- The odd Nep style quote
- Much, Much more!
