# CPU Purple Heart
![Nep Nep](https://caboosh.s-ul.eu/NpVgetoh.png)

The Lovable CPU of Planeptune has smashed the 4th wall hard enough to make it onto discord somehow, don't ask me how, she just did, alrite?

# Setup and botconfig making
## Requirements:
- GitPython
- discord.py rewrite (1.0.0a)
- Latest version of Python

## Installing
- Refer to wiki for installation

## Botconfig.py file
This file should contain 3 variables as of now, "token" , "prefix" , and "botdesc".
These varables are imported in the main bot.py as to allow somewhat dynamic changing of these (desc and prefix) elements through either the bot or just by editing the botconfig.py file. 

basically, the botconfig.py should look like this:
```python
prefix='Prefix Here'
token='Token Here'
botdesc='The Bot Description here'
```
